## **Define**-ing a function.

The syntax to define a function starts with the function header, which consists of the following:

```
<return_type> <function_name>([parameters]); // <---- I'm a function header!
```

In here, `return_type` can be any of the **types** that we have learned so far:

* `int`: integer
* `float`: **single**-precision floating-point number
* `double`: **double**-precision floating-point number
* `void`: nothing, the void of emptiness

`function_name` can be anything that your heart desires, are long as it doesn't start with a number or any of the special keywords we use in C.

`parameters` are optional (represented by the square brackets []). Because it's optional, it means that we can define 0 or more of these parameters. How do parameters usually look like? They look like new variables, each one separated by a comma! For example, for a function called `print_error` that **accepts** an integer representing the error number, the parameter (and overall header) would look like this:

``` c
void print_error(int error);
//               ^ declaring a variable called `error` that is of type `int`
```

However, a function **header** doesn't do anything... Remember that the function header is like a contract we programmers define to tell C what the function should return and what it should accept, so that we don't use it incorrectly. (You don't want the sqrt to return nothing because it should return a double!)

To execute some code, we need the function **body**, which is the code that we wrap with the curly braces after a function header.

``` c
void print_error(int error) // <---- We got rid of the semicolon here, why?
{
  // I'm in the function body!
}
```

If you took a look at the previous code block, you will see that we removed the semicolon (`;`) from the function header and added opening `{` and closing `}` curly braces to represent the function body, where we can execute the function code (whatever that may be). **Remember** that a semicolon represents the end of a statement, so if we add it next to a function, it means that the function has no body and, therefore, no code to execute (so why even have a function header? More on that as it develops...).

## **Invoke**-ing or **call**-ing a function.

Now that we defined the `print_error` function, which is a `void` function (meaning that it returns nothing, the void of emptiness), we can call it to run the code. Wait, what? If I write a function, doesn't it run automatically? Simply put, no.

Say that you have the following program:

``` c
void print_one(void)
{
  printf("I'm in print_one\n");
}

void print_two(void)
{
  printf("I'm in print_two\n");
}

int main(void)
{
  printf("I'm in main!\n");

  return 0;
}
```

What is going to be the output?

In C, the only program that is executed (run) by default is `main` function, so we will only see

```
I'm in main!
```

if we run the program. To execute the code from the other two functions, we have to call them - let's do that!

To call a function we also follow another pattern:

```
<function_name>([arguments]); // <---- I'm calling a function!
```

Here, `<function_name>` is the name of the function we defined earlier. In this example, we have two functions called `print_one` and `print_two`.

`arguments` are the values we *pass* into the function. **Notice** that they are not called parameters. We call parameters the variables on a function definition and arguments the variables that we pass into that function. Since both our functions accept `void`, we can call these functions with an empty parenthesis:

``` c
void print_one(void)
{
  printf("I'm in print_one\n");
}

void print_two(void)
{
  printf("I'm in print_two\n");
}

int main(void)
{
  printf("I'm in main!\n");
  print_one();
  print_two();

  return 0;
}
```

What would be the output now?

As a final exercise, determine why the following small programs are incorrect.

1. What is the value of `sum_of_numbers`?

  ``` c
  int sum(int num1, int num2)
  {
    return num1 + num2;
  }

  int main(void)
  {
    int sum_of_numbers;

    sum(1, 1);

    printf("sum_of_numbers should be 2. Its value is, %d\n", sum_of_numbers);

    return 0;
  }
  ```

2. What is the output of this program? Does it run?

  ``` c
  int sum(int num1, num2)
  {
    return num1 + num2;
  }

  int main(void)
  {
    int sum_of_numbers = sum(1, 1);

    printf("sum_of_numbers should be 2. Its value is, %d\n", sum_of_numbers);

    return 0;
  }
  ```

3. Does the `result` in `main` get updated? What is its value at the end?

  ``` c
  int sum(int num1, int num2, int result)
  {
    result = num1 + num2;

    return 0;
  }

  int main(void)
  {
    int result;

    sum(1, 1, result);

    printf("result should be 2. Its value is: %d\n", result);
  }
  ```

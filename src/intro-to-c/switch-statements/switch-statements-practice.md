# Switch Statements

Here is some additional practice with switch statements. 

@. You're a time traveler with a computer, but it happens to have very limited capabilities thanks to the time police. You also happen to be a history buff that loves the Roman Empire, so you traveled back in time with your silly little programable computer to the silly little Roman Empire. You've decided to teach the Romans modern arabic numbers rather than their weird letter numbers. To expidite the teaching process, you want to make a program that can convert modern integers into Roman numerals up to 10. Write a program that uses a switch statement to convert integers up to 10 into Roman numerals. Remember, the Romans didn't have a number for 0.
